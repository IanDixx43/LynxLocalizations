## Updates and adding new languages

Fork this repo to your GitHub account. If you are updating strings for an existing language, directly edit the files in the corresponding .lproj folder for the language. Create a pull request to add the updated strings.

To add a new language, check [here](https://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html) for the language identifier. Copy the en.lproj folder, and rename ```en``` to the identifier of your language. When completed, add this folder to the root of this repository and create a pull request that I can merge.

If you have trouble using GitHub or want to send me your language separately, contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mtac8) or send me an [email](mailto:mtac@mtac.app)
